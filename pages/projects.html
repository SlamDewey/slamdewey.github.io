                    This project was my first attempt at making a fully functional 2D game engine written entirely from 
                    scratch in Java.  Let's just say it was a success.
                    The engine is broken up into two main sections: The Physics Engine, and The Graphics Engine.
                    <br />
                    I'll go into detail about both below, but first consider watching the video demonstration and reading its description.

                    First off, I'd like to talk about the physics engine, as I liked this part of the project much more (it was 
                    WAY easier to debug).  The Physics Engine (and all of its classes) is/are stored in the 'src/components' 
                    folder, and because the engine is really quite large, I'll try to cover each sub-section only briefly.
                    <br />

                        Physics			{Collider, Transform}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are only Transforms and Colliders that really make up the bulk of the physics engine functionality, 
                        and assuming you don't know what these do I'll describe them quickly.  The Collider contains arrays of 
                        2D vectors (essentially coordinates) that represent a hitbox around the object.  This can either be auto-
                        generated (as in the BoxCollider or EllipseCollider classes) or can be custom written and passed into the 
                        Collider after creation.  Also, as you may expect, the Collider can check if two hitboxes are colliding.  The 
                        Collider class uses a static instance of an enum (defined upon initialization) to choose between two 
                        forms of collision detection.  These are SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) and a standard Vector 
                        Intersection Edge Test.  I won't describe these methods here as I didn't invent them, just implemented.  
                        Finally, the Collider can also perform 2D ray casting, for collision prediction, and general range finding.  
                        The Transform is the simpler of the two. This class manages 2D vectors for position, velocity, force, and 
                        acceleration.  In addition, this class manages object mass, rotation angle, and rotational velocity.  (Shout 
                        tout to Mr. Arner at Springfield Township High School for teaching me these topics in AP Physics C)

                        Abstract Classes	{GameObject, CollidableObject, Entity, EnviornmentObject}

                    <p>
                        These abstract classes build the base for abstraction of physics objects.  Essentially a CollidableObject 
                        is an abstract class with a Transform and Collider.  It has a few important methods that can optionally 
                        be overwritten upon 
                        extension: onCollision(CollidableObject obj), onDelete().  Obviously the more important function here is 
                        onCollision(), this is called from the Scene when two objects are detected as 'colliding' during a given 
                        frame.  The Scene calls the function for both objects.   A GameObject is simply a CollidableObject that 
                        also contains a TexturedModel reference (more on this later).

                        Physics Scene and 	{Scene, Spacial Decomposition, QuadTree, AABB}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The physics Scene management was a pure invention of mine that I am honestly quite proud of.  I based 
                        this on the structure of the Unity3D engine and even took its name 'Scene'.  The way it works is we keep 
                        a linked list of all known GameObjects.  Upon every tick() (called from the math-thread at a set interval) 
                        we tick() the physics Scene and therefore the world.  The Scene begins its massive tick() function by 
                        iterating through all GameObjects and calling their individual tick()'s.  This updates the Transform for 
                        each object and prepares the object for collision detection.  In this same loop, the Scene adds each 
                        object to a QuadTree by defining AABB's (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) for each object.  The QuadTree is a 
                        recursive class designed to accept a high quantity of point particles, and store them in a tree.  The tree is 
                        significant because instead of checking if each object is colliding with any of the other objects, we simple 
                        query the tree for objects within a specified bounds of the object, and check those.  This brings collision 
                        detection performance down from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).  For more information on QuadTree's and 
                        AABB's, visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Wikipedia page about this topic.</a>  Moving on, besides worldwide collision 
                        detection and object management, the Scene also is a camera!  It contains its own Transform (and 
                        therefore position, rotation, velocity, etc) and can move about the physics world.  The viewport 
                        specified by the combination of the Window size, and the Scene's Transform determine which objects 
                        should be drawn by the graphics engine.  As well the focus Transform of the Scene can easily be updated 
                        a reference to any GameObject's Transform, and therefore center that object on the screen.

                        The Graphics Engine
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I'll recall some descriptions of the graphics engine itself and its functionality.  The graphics engine 
                        uses OpenGL and GLFW, normally something reserved for web or C++ graphics development, but thanks 
                        to a popular Java library known as LWJGL, this amazing technology is being shifted to Java as well. For 
                        more information about LWJGL, visit their site <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/"> here </a>.  The LWJGL implementation of GLFW 
                        conveniently threads graphics for you and its extremely easy to set up, so you don't have to worry about 
                        much synchronization.  Thread problems only arise in the physics engine.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The structure of the graphics engine is based loosely on a few YouTube series I was able to sit through.  
                        Firstly, I'd like to thank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix/">ThinMatrix</a> for his amazing series on an older version of LWJGL, and for 
                        showing a basic implementation of a graphics engine for a mock-up game.  Although my implementation 
                        was simpler (as mine was 2D, and his was 3D) I followed a similar rendering structure.  I created generic 
                        static definitions of different textures, models, and textured-models (in that order) upon engine startup, 
                        and loaded copies of them into VRAM.  Then I used data coming in from the physics engine to determine 
                        how exactly to scale/translate/rotate these textured-models to represent each object.  I used a 
                        collection of static textured-models because I was simply crafting clones of their vertex arrays, when I 
                        wanted to draw them as an object.  This allowed me to have thousands upon thousands of objects 
                        floating around the screen, drawn very efficiently, because the processor would access the same 
                        memory block upon each render() function call.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I used a magical class located in 'src/graphics/GL/entities/' known as a GraphicalEntity that was 
                        attached to every object in my physics engine.  This class acted like a courier of data, transferring only 
                        what the graphics engine cared about into a format it could read.  Having this attached to all physics 
                        objects meant I could easily update the graphics component upon a frame tick() if necessary.

                    Multide was a software study done for my high school senior thesis project.  The study was in creating a 
                    software capable of hosting live file editing between many clients.  This is where both the name and 
                    logo come from; Multide being multi-personal IDE, and the logo is a symbol representing many 
                    connections interweaving at one point.  This project was a successful proof of concept thanks to support 
                    of the Springfield Township High School Library and Technology Department.  I must specifically thank 
                    their leniency as they let me confiscate an old (scheduled for destruction) desktop and install my own 
                    software on it (this was the server), and without this allowance the project wouldn't have gotten near 
                    it's final state.  This all being said the project was never more than a software proof of concept, so 
                    although the concept was proven, the software is not complete (not really an IDE, nor an easily usable 
                    text-editor).  I'll now briefly mention the main sections of the project.

                    Essentially, this program ran a server which acted like a connection hub for up to 10 clients.  This hub 
                    really acted as a sort of echoing bridge.  I say this because when a client would broadcast that it updated 
                    the open file, the server would broadcast to all connected clients the new information.  Although this is 
                    probably quite easy to imagine, it is not as easy to implement.  Specifically deciding how much data the 
                    client needed to send to the server to represent all the changes it made.  The most reliable method I 
                    was able to implement was to send the entire file in each broadcast message.  Why would I do 
                    something so crazy? (you may ask) ' Well the original idea I had was to send specifically the line 
                    numbers that changed, but I quickly ran into problems when two clients would change similar lines at 
                    similar times.  For instance, if client1 deletes line 4 of his file, his file becomes one line shorter and all of 
                    the line data from client2's file is instantly invalid.  This also ruined my idea of sending a range of data 
                    around the detected change.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time on the actual programming 
                    portion of this project to determine a more accurate and efficient method for sending data, but I would 
                    imagine a realistic solution simply requires creating a standard format for stating which lines changed, 
                    and how they changed.  I also assume it should be easy enough to create line numbers that are relative 
                    to major sections of the file (this is for code after all, so if a function is edited, we can assume the edit 
                    happened after the function header, right?).   Anyway, I couldn't implement this as correctly as I 
                    would've wished, but after all it was just a proof of concept.

                    You likely will now have two strong opinions about this project (if you've even read this far) and I would 
                    predict they are quite polarizing.  Either you think this is a genius idea, or quite stupid and will never 
                    work.  To those who don't already think this idea was genius, I'd like to mention an upcoming website 
                    (as of 2019) at <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a>  This fantastic website (that used to allow you to simply write code online 
                    for free) has added a new feature known as 'Multiplayer Mode'.  This is an exact example of the concept 
                    I proved in this senior thesis, allowing many users to edit the same program simultaneously by 
                    communication through a hub.  I do plan to return to this project and at least create a fully functional 
                    version of the software.  Why?  There are still benefits to creating this as a desktop software, and not 
                    cloud-based (like repl).  The only problem with having 'Multiplayer' on repl is the limitation of the site 
                    itself.  You can only create and run programs that print to console.  Therefore, there is still a possibility 
                    for this software to be widely usable.

                    First I think its important to mention all of the animated background on this site were written 
                    in JavaScript entirely by me, and include MIT licenses crediting myself as an author.  
                    If you wish to reuse the backdrop or any of the JS code, it is all available on the GitHub 
                    repository for this site (linked above).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is a project which began in early February of 2019, inspired by my work in the Temple 
                    Hack4Impact chapter and from websites of my peers.  Somewhere around the beginning of the year I 
                    had concretely decided I wanted to create a website to show off my favorite projects, resume, and etc. 
                    for job recruiting (because lets be honest who else really wants to read all this junk) and after 
                    discovering you can host a site essentially for free through GitHub, I began programming.  This site is 
                    open-source and uses some create JavaScript to show off (quickly and visually) some of my 
                    programming skill.  You may have noticed the background of the home page for this site is interactive.  
                    Sure, dragging those interconnected balls around the screen sure is fun, but there also exists a tiny link 
                    at the bottom of the site to 'Play with the backdrop'.  This deletes all the content from the page (except 
                    the HTML5 Canvas element I'm drawing to) and creates a series of buttons to control features in the 
                    backdrop for a more entertaining session of 'playing with bouncing balls on Jared Massa's website'.  
                </p>
                <div class="content-img-container">
                    <div class="content-img" id="dev" style="width:560px;height:315px;margin:0;padding:0;">
                    </div>
                    <br />
                    Yes this is just a screenshot of VSCode with my code in it!
                </div>
                <p>
                    Before talking too much about the backdrops I'd like to mention the structure of JavaScript happening 
                    behind the scenes when you load up the site.  A combination of 'scripts.js' and 'backdrop.js' are used to 
                    dynamically build and animate the webpage based on your browsing window size.  I spent quite an 
                    amount of time fiddling with CSS to perfect the animations, and simply ended up using JavaScript 
                    anyway for its reliability.  The 'backdrop.js' file will choose a random backdrop (from an array of 
                    predefined backdrops) load the necessary extra JavaScript files.  This includes any necessary 
                    dependencies (loaded from the 'javascript_dependencies' folder). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backdrops themselves are examples of a QuadTrees, used in 2D collision detection.  This is a special 
                    type of recursive tree structure commonly used for organizing ranges of object density throughout a 
                    space.  This tree is especially useful in object collision detection, as we can query the tree in O(logn) time 
                    for a set of objects in a given range (rather than the traditional O(n) time for an array of objects).  You can 
                    read more about the 
                    efficiency on Wikipedia, but essentially this bring a collision detection algorithm down from O(n^2) to 
                    O(nlogn). This is the reason I can efficiently draw lines between balls, and bubble them based on distance to mouse.  
                    So really the backdrop is an example of 
                    a collision detection method, and one that I have experience with. I used this before in my 
                    Java 2D Game Engine project (read more about this under Java Projects > 2D Game Engine).  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the 
                    backdrop, QuadTree, and components used in the QuadTree (AABB) are available open source in this 
                    website's repository (Use the GitHub icon at the top of the page).
                    Note: QuadTree.js and AABB.js are in the 'javascript_dependencies' folder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I encourage anybody who has read this far to check out the JavaScript code and fiddle with it yourself.
