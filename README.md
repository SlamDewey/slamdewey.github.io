# [slamdewey.github.io] (https://slamdewey.github.io/)
This is the repository for Jared Massa's (@slamdewey) Personal website, written using the Angular CLI.

This `readme.md` will be expanded as the site progresses in development.

## Project Structure
The site presented here is quite simple and uses the standard component based structure of Angular applications.
The Angular Router is used to display different components as pages, however all pages feature the [site-header](https://github.com/SlamDewey/slamdewey.github.io/tree/master/src/app/shared/site-header) component as a side navigation bar.


The three main pages of the site are the:
 - [Home Page](https://github.com/SlamDewey/slamdewey.github.io/tree/master/src/app/home)
 - [Hobbies & Projects Page](https://github.com/SlamDewey/slamdewey.github.io/tree/master/src/app/projects)
 - [Gallery Page](https://github.com/SlamDewey/slamdewey.github.io/tree/master/src/app/gallery)


## Color Palette
This site uses a 5 color palette for styling.  You may see this in `styles.css` or below:
 - primary:     `#FA7921`

 - tertiary:    `#0D3B66`
